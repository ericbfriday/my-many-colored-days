Some days are yellow some are blue on different days I'm Different too you'd be surprised how many ways I change on different colored days on bright red days how good it feels to be a horse and kick my heels on other days I'm other things on bright blue days I flap My Wings some days of course feel sort of brown then I feel Slow and Low low

down then comes a yellow day and wee I am a busy Buzzy Bee gray day everything is gray I watch but nothing moves today then all of a sudden I'm a circus seal on my orange days that's how I feel green days deep deep in the sea cool and quiet fish that's

me on purple days I'm sad I groan I drag my tail I walk alone but when my days are happy pink it's great to jump and just not think then come my black days mad and loud I hul I growl at every cloud then comes a mixed up day and Wham I don't know who or what I am but it all turns out all right you see and I go go back to being me
